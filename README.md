# Logic Tools
Logic Tools is a project of [IDEAS](https://ideas.science.uu.nl//#projects).

## Installation
### Requirements
You will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to be able to compile this project. We use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle the `src` files together. Run
```sh
npm install
```
to install the requirements found in `package.json`. With the requirements installed you can run
```sh
npx webpack
```
to compile the `src` directory into bundles. You can also specify the directory that webpack outputs to with `-o output_dir`.

### Developer Server
You will need to have HTTP server running to serve the files produced by webpack. LogEx uses local and session storage, which will not work correctly if accessing the pages through files. If you have Python 3 installed you can use the following command in the root directory of the project to serve the files.

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Refer to [this AskUbuntu post](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1102594/how-do-i-set-up-the-simplest-http-local-server) for alternatives for setting up a simple HTTP server. Please remember this server is only to be used for local development and never for production.

After setting up the HTTP server you can access the tools by redirecting your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

### Production Server
In production the your server (nginx/apache) can serve the files generated by webpack.
